# Other Building Blocks

This course covered the basics of getting started with NestJS, but there are a couple of building blocks that we have not covered yet or only scratched the surface.

* Dependency Injection (DI)
* Interceptors
* Microservices
* CQRS
* Health Checks
* Prisma / Sequelize / Mongoose
* Websockets
* Creating a CLI with NestJS
* Hot-Module Replacement
* ...etc.
